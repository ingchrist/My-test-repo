## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

A DRF project for TripValue. It covers all features of Transportation, Trip, Transporters, Booking, Orders, Logistics and Security System for ensuring daily trip and delivery success.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For installing the project, you will need to have
- Python installed. Python version supported is `3.9`. The Github actions use 3.9 for running live tests.
- Must have PostgreSQL installed. You can use WSL2 to do this on Windows 10 and 11.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TripValue/backend_block/
cd backend_block
```

Setup env & install dependencies

Linux

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd tripapi
mkdir logs
```

Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd tripapi
mkdir logs
```

There are examples specific to your development enviroment. `env.dev.example` is for development and `env.production.example` is for production. You can copy the example files to `.env` and fill in the values.

```bash
cp env.dev.example .env
```

Run migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

Run the server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```


> For the database keys in the env file, you should use your postgres user and password. You can create a new user and password for the project. You can also use the default postgres user and password.


## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Run tests to make sure all is working before you start contributing

```bash
pytest --no-cov
```

### And coding style tests

This must be used to ensure all coding style guidelines are met

```bash
flake8
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To run the API on your local system.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

API server will run on `http://localhost:8000/`. Visit [Swagger](http://localhost:8000/admin/api/docs/) to read the Swagger API documentation.


## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

The following method describes how to deploy this on a live system.

### Using Ngrok
- Install [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started) on your machine.
- Run API server
- Open CMD / CLI, Run `ngrok http 8000`. `8000` is used if that's the port the API server is listening to. Otherwise, use the listening port.
- The rest is history!


### Using Nginx on an Ubuntu Server
#### Coming soon!
<!-- A deploy script.sh should be created to automate the deployment on a new server -->
